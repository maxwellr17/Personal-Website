# Personal-Website

After coming across some neat websites with eye catching, moving background animations, I wanted to try and make one myself! 

This website neatly presents basic information about me with an alluring animation of moving nodes, connected by edges that vary in opacity as a function of each node's proximity to other nodes. I used javascript for the animation, and HTML/CSS for the text and information about me. Check out my code to see how it works!
